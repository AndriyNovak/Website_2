                        <p>Buffering can ruin your video streaming experience while being detrimental to those who profit from your viewing. Tired of the rotating circle appearing on your screen? <a href="">Amped Wifi promises to make a difference.</a></p>
                    </blockquote>  
                    <p>Simply plug-in Amped WiFi™ to automatically connect to your existing WiFi network. Its so easy-to-use and its compatible with every <a href="">USA Internet Service Provider (ISP).</a></p>   
                    <p>Amped WiFi™ is a powerful, efficient, strong WI-FI DEVICE that was developed from a military technology called “signal amped transmission”. This is the same type of technology that you may have all heard about during the heroic rescue of the Thai Soccer Team that was trapped in a cave.</p>
                    <img src="img/cave.jpg" alt="cave">
                    <p>One of the problems was that the solid rock walls of the caves blocked all radio transmission, but an Israeli super-high-tech company developed a system that allowed many walkie talkies to capture and boost a weak signal so that it could travel all the way through the cave to all the rescue divers.</p>
                    <p>The average home internet user will experience a drop in signal for WiFi at least once a day. Poor internet coverage across the United States, and within the average American home, is a huge problem. Amped WiFi™ was designed and manufactured to solve this problem. <b>It's easy to install, connects to your existing network, and acts as a signal amplifier.</b></p>
